    # * foolscap < 0.6.3 is incompatible with Twisted 11.1.0 and newer.

    # * foolscap >= 0.12.5 has ConnectionInfo and ReconnectionInfo
    # * foolscap >= 0.12.6 has an i2p.sam_endpoint() that takes kwargs

    #   rekeying bug <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4395>
    # * The SFTP frontend and manhole depend on the conch extra. However, we
    #   can't explicitly declare that without an undesirable dependency on gmpy,
    #   as explained in ticket #2740.
    # * Due to a setuptools bug, we need to declare a dependency on the tls
    #   extra even though we only depend on it via foolscap.
    # * Twisted >= 15.1.0 is the first version that provided the [tls] extra.
    # * Twisted-16.1.0 fixes https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/8223,
    #   which otherwise causes test_system to fail (DirtyReactorError, due to
    #   leftover timers)
    # * Twisted-16.4.0 introduces `python -m twisted.trial` which is needed
    #   for coverage testing
    # * Twisted 16.6.0 drops the undesirable gmpy dependency from the conch
    #   extra, letting us use that extra instead of trying to duplicate its
    #   dependencies here.  Twisted[conch] >18.7 introduces a dependency on
    #   bcrypt.  It is nice to avoid that if the user ends up with an older
    #   version of Twisted.  That's hard to express except by using the extra.
    #
    # * Twisted 18.4.0 adds `client` and `host` attributes to `Request` in the
    # * initializer, needed by logic in our custom `Request` subclass.
    #
    #   In a perfect world, Twisted[conch] would be a dependency of an "sftp"
    #   extra.  However, pip fails to resolve the dependencies all
    #   dependencies when asked for Twisted[tls] *and* Twisted[conch].
    #   Specifically, "Twisted[conch]" (as the later requirement) is ignored.
    #   If there were an Tahoe-LAFS sftp extra that dependended on
    #   Twisted[conch] and install_requires only included Twisted[tls] then
    #   `pip install tahoe-lafs[sftp]` would not install requirements
    #   specified by Twisted[conch].  Since this would be the *whole point* of
    #   an sftp extra in Tahoe-LAFS, there is no point in having one.
    # * Twisted 19.10 introduces Site.getContentFile which we use to get
    #   temporary upload files placed into a per-node temporary directory.
    # * Twisted 22.8.0 added support for coroutine-returning functions in many
    #   places (mainly via `maybeDeferred`)
