# Gitlab Deployment Changelog

Home of this code is now https://github.com/ExB-Group/gitlab-deployment-changelog 

This package grabs the last `n` deployments for a project from gitlab and creates a summary of the merge requests
and their issues. Decoration is done based on scoped labels `type::`. As of now we cover `bug`. Everything else is
considered as a feature. Merge requests without issues, were indicated as well.


## Mandatory setup
