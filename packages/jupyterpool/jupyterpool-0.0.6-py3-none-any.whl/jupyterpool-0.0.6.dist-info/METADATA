# 🪐 🎱 Jupyterpool

> A pool of Jupyter pre-warmed and pre-mounted kernels.

Jupyterpool is a pool of Jupyter Kernels that are pre-warmed with code and pre-mounted with content. It solves the cold-start Kernel issue.

Jupyterpool serves user interfaces or processes eager to consume code execution from Kernels.

A set of available Kernels is maintained on a Kubernetes cluster. Those Kernels can be configured to pre-run defined code before being available and have mounted local or remote drives. A defined number of available Kernels (min and max) is guaranteed by Jupyterpool.

```bash
pip install -e .[test,k8s]
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
jupyter labextension list
jupyter server extension list
yarn jupyterlab
```
