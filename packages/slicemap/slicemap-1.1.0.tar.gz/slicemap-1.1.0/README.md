Slicemap is a MIT licensed library introducing a useful, dictionary-like data structure,
similar to normal Python dict, but instead of setting values key by key, you set entire slices.

Features:

* Implemented entirely in Python
* Has only one dependency: [sortedcontainers](https://grantjenks.com/docs/sortedcontainers/)
* Is efficient, it has ``O(log(n))`` time complexity for insertion and query
    * Adding new slices might make old ones become redundant
    * ``n`` correspondes to the maximal number of slices present in SliceMap at a time
* Makes life easier, see [applications](https://slicemap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/applications/)

## Example

```py
from slicemap import SliceMap
sm = SliceMap()
sm[-3:3] = 0.1
sm[6.5:] = "Hello, SliceMap"
print(sm[0])
print(sm[10])
```

```stdout
0.1
'Hello, SliceMap'
```
