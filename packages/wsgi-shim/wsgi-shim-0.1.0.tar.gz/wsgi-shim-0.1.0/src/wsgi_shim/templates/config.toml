[wsgi]
# This section identifies the entry point into the Python module that
# implements your site.  When the site is in Maintenance Mode (see
# docs), this section is ignored and the module is not imported.
# (This is useful when first standing up your website.)

# If your app is not already installed in your virtual environment,
# use the optional chdir entry.  Its value will be added to sys.path
# and the current directory will be set to this (needed for Django).
# chdir = "/path/to/my/package/directory"

# The Python module containing your code can either be a module available
# in the virtual environment or the absolute path to a Python module
# (a bare .py file or a directory with an included __init__.py file).

[secret_files]
# Key-value pairs in this section are passed along to the application
# environment as in the [environment] section, below.  Also, an additional
# check is performed to ensure that the value is a file path that exists
# and that has restricted permissions appropriate for holding secrets.
# Specifically, this means not world accessible and only group-accessible if
# the group is not the user's default group or if the user's default group
# name is the same as the user's username.
# It is up to your website code to read and interpret the contents of these
# files using, for example, the dotenv_values function of
# https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/
# Note: if wsgi_shim detects that the site is not configured correctly,
# these keys (but *not* their value) may be included in the HTML shown
# to someone visiting your site.
# Values must be absolute paths:
# CONFIG_DOTENV = "/n/fs/myproject/mywebsitefiles/secrets/credentials.env"


[environment]
# Key-value pairs in this section are passed along to the application
# environment and accessible with the Python os.environ object.  Keys in
# this section must not also be defined in the [secret_files] section.
# Note: if wsgi_shim detects that the site is not configured correctly,
# these keys (but *not* their value) may be included in the HTML shown
# to someone visiting your site.
# For example:
# LOG_FILENAME = "/n/fs/myproject/mywebsitefiles/log/logfile"
