           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

#  RDBUnit: Unit testing for relational database queries

[![rdbunit CI](https://github.com/dspinellis/rdbunit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dspinellis/rdbunit/actions/workflows/ci.yml)


**RDBUnit** is a unit testing framework for relational database queries.
It allows you to express in a simple way the setup prior to a query,
the query, and the expected results.
RDBUnit can test `SELECT` queries as well as queries that are used
for creating tables and views.
All types of queries can be either embedded into the test script, or
they can be included from an external file.
The tables for the input and the expected results can be created with
minimal ceremony: RDBUnit will automatically infer the types of the
tables' fields.

For complex relational OLAP queries *RDBUnit* can be combined particularly
effectively with the [simple-rolap](https://github.com/dspinellis/simple-rolap)
relational online analytical processing framework.
You can find a complete tutorial on using *RDBUnit* with *simple-rolap*
for mining Git repositories in a
[technical briefing](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7513793)
presented at the 2017 International Conference on Software Engineering.

You can cite this work as follows.

## Installation

### Using Pip
```sh
pip install rdbunit
```

### From source
* Clone this repository
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/dspinellis/rdbunit.git
cd rdbunit
pipenv shell
pip install .
```

## Test specification
For every SQL query you want to test, create an *RDBUnit* file that
specifies the query's input, execution, and expected result.

### Simple example
The following example illustrates this concept.
```
BEGIN SETUP
sales:
month   revenue
March   130
April   50
END

BEGIN SELECT
SELECT MAX(revenue) as max_revenue FROM sales;
END

BEGIN RESULT
max_revenue
130
END
```

### Input file details
The input and output and output are specified as table contents.
The input starts with a line containing the words `BEGIN SETUP`,
while the results start with a line containing the words
`BEGIN RESULTS`.
The input and output are specified by first giving a table's name,
followed by a colon.
The name may be prefixed by the name of a database where the table
is to reside, followed by a dot.
The next row contains the table's fields, separated by spaces.
Then comes the table's data, which is terminated by a blank line,
or by the word `END`.
More than one table can be specified in the setup.
In the results the table name is not specified, if the tested
query is a selection statement, rather than a table or view creation.
The setup-query-results sequence can be specified multiple times within
a test file.

### Setup example
```
BEGIN SETUP
contacts:
name    registered      value   reg_date
John    true            12      '2015-03-02'
Mary    false           10      '2012-03-02'
END
```

### Results example (named table)
Named table results are used with `CREATE` queries.
```
BEGIN RESULT
leadership.nl_commits_leader_comments:
project_id      n
1               3
END
```

### Results example (unnamed set)
Unnamed set results are used with `SELECT` queries.
```
BEGIN RESULT
name    registered      value   reg_date        a
John    True            12      '2015-03-02'    Null
END
```

The query to test is either specified inline with a `BEGIN SELECT` (for
selection queries) or `BEGIN CREATE` (for creation queries) statement,
or by including a file through the corresponding `INCLUDE SELECT` or
`INCLUDE CREATE` statement.

### Inline example
```
BEGIN SELECT
SELECT *, NULL AS a FROM contacts WHERE registered;
END
```

### External query example
```
INCLUDE CREATE nl_commits_leader_comments.sql
```

## Unit testing
To run the tests run *RDBUnit* piping its output to one of the supported
relational database systems (current *MySQL*, *PostgreSQL*, and *sqLite*).
A number of command-line flags allow you to tailor the operation of
*RDBUnit*.
When running, *RDBUnit* will report on its output something like
`ok 1 - recent_commit_projects.rdbu: test_stratsel.recent_commit_projects`
for each succeeding test case and
`not ok 1 - project_stars.rdbu: test_stratsel.project_stars` for each failing
test case.
A final line will list the number of succeeding and failing test cases.
By default *RDBUnit* creates and operates on temporary databases,
whose name is prefixed with the word `test_`.

By specifying the `--results` option (or the equivalent `-r` short option)
you can direct _rdbunit_ to display the table generated for each test.
This is useful for debugging test failures or for generating reference data
(after suitable manual verification).

### Execution example (SQLite)
```sh
$ rdbunit --database=sqlite recent_commit_projects.rdbu | sqlite3
ok 1 - recent_commit_projects.rdbu: test_stratsel.recent_commit_projects
```

### Execution example (MySQL)
```sh
$ rdbunit commits_comments.rdbu | mysql -u root -p -N
Enter password:
ok 1 - commits_comments.rdbu: test_leadership.nl_commits_leader_comments
ok 2 - commits_comments.rdbu: test_leadership.leader_commits_nl_comments
ok 3 - commits_comments.rdbu: test_leadership.commits_with_comments
1..3
```

### Execution example (PostgreSQL)
```sh
$ rdbunit --database=postgresql commits_comments.rdbu | psql -U ght -h 127.0.0.1 -t -q ghtorrent
 ok 1 - commits_comments.rdbu: test_leadership.nl_commits_leader_comments

 ok 2 - commits_comments.rdbu: test_leadership.leader_commits_nl_comments

 ok 3 - commits_comments.rdbu: test_leadership.commits_with_comments

 1..3
```

## Development

Contributions via GitHub pull requests are welcomed.
Each contribution passes through continuous integration,
which verifies the code's style (_pycodestyle_) and checks for errors
(_pylint_).
It also tests the input and output of _RDBunit_ and its operation on the
three supported relational database systems.
On a local host, after creating a virtual environment (`pipenv`),
entering it (`pipenv shell`), and
installing the required development dependencies (`pipenv install --dev`),
you can run the following commands.

* ``pycodestyle src/rdbunit/__main__.py`
* `pylint src/rdbunit/__main__.py`
* `tests/test-parts.sh`
* `tests/test-sqlite.sh`
