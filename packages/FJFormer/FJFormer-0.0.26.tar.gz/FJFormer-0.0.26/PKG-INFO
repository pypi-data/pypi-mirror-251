# FJFormer

Embark on a journey of paralleled/unparalleled computational prowess with FJFormer - an arsenal of custom Jax Flax
Functions and Utils that elevate your AI endeavors to new heights!

## Overview

FJFormer is a collection of functions and utilities that can help with various tasks when using Flax and JAX. It
includes
checkpoint savers, partitioning tools, and other helpful functions.
The goal of FJFormer is to make your life easier when working with Flax and JAX. Whether you are training a new model,
fine-tuning an existing one, or just exploring the capabilities of these powerful frameworks, FJFormer offers

- FlashAttention on `TPU/GPU` ðŸ§¬
- BITComputations for 8,6,4 BIT Flax Models
- Smart Dataset Loading
- Built-in functions and Loss functions
- GPU-Pallas triton like implementation of `Softmax`, `FlashAttention`, `RMSNorm`, `LayerNorm`
- Distributed and sharding Model Loaders and Checkpoint Savers
- Monitoring Utils for *TPU/GPU/CPU* memory `foot-print`
- Special Optimizers with schedulers and Easy to Use
- Partitioning Utils

and A lot of these features are fully documented so i gusse FJFormer has something
to offer, and it's not just a Computation BackEnd for [EasyDel](https://github.com/erfanzar/EasyDel).
