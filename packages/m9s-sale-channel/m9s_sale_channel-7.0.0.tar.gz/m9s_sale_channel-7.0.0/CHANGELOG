Version 5.2.7
* Permission model removed: it causes substantial trouble in multicompany
  setups and access permissions should be solved with Tryton standard access 
  permissions.
* Pricelist on channels was factored out to sale_channel_pricelist for the
  reason to get out of the way in multicompany setups with pricelists per company.
Version 4.0
* Default account revenue and expense fields has been removed from sale
  channel. One should ask for these while importing products.
