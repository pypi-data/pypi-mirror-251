# [Material You color algorithms](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/overview) for python!


## Minimal running example:

Run file `tests/test_color_gen.py` as:

```console
python3 test_color_gen.py <image path> <quality>

```
Maximum quality is `1` that means use all pixels, and quality number more than `1` means how many pixels to skip in between while reading, also you can see it as compression.
