class SQL:
    """A class for handling SQL queries with dynamic bindings.

    This class allows for the creation of SQL queries with variable bindings. It supports various data types for these bindings,
    including dataframes, nested SQL queries, strings, and primitive types. The class provides functionality to convert the query
    with its bindings to a string and to collect dataframes associated with the query.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sql : str
        The SQL query string with placeholders for bindings
    **bindings : dict
        Variable keyword arguments representing the bindings for the SQL query. The keys are the placeholder names in the SQL query,
        and the values are the actual values to be bound to these placeholders.

    Methods
    -------
    to_string() -> str
        Converts the SQL query with its bindings to a string, with appropriate formatting and escaping of values.

    collect_dataframes() -> Mapping[str, pd.DataFrame]
        Collects and returns a mapping of dataframe identifiers to their respective pandas DataFrame objects from the bindings.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        If a binding name does not exist in the SQL query.
    ValueError
        If a binding is of an invalid type that cannot be converted to a string representation for the SQL query.

    Notes
    -----
    - The method `to_string` handles different data types by converting them to their appropriate string representations in the SQL query.
      For instance, dataframes are represented by a unique identifier, and strings are escaped properly.
    - The method `collect_dataframes` is useful for retrieving the dataframes involved in the SQL query, especially when dealing with nested SQL queries.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> query = SQL("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $id", id=123)
    >>> print(query.to_string())
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123"

    >>> df = pd.DataFrame(...)
    >>> query = SQL("INSERT INTO data VALUES $data", data=df)
    >>> dfs = query.collect_dataframes()
    >>> print(dfs)
    {'df_<unique_id_of_df>': <corresponding_dataframe>}

        Creates an SQL object from a file, optionally incorporating additional bindings.

        This class method reads an SQL query from a file, allowing for initial bindings to be specified within the file and
        supplemented by additional bindings passed as keyword arguments. The method supports S3AwarePath as file paths, facilitating
        seamless integration with local and S3 file systems. It also handles an optional header in the file specifying initial bindings
        in a Python dictionary format. This enables dynamic construction of SQL objects with pre-defined or externally supplied bindings.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fpath : S3AwarePath
            The file path (supporting S3 paths) from which to read the SQL query.
        **bindings : dict, optional
            Additional variable keyword arguments representing bindings for the SQL query. These bindings will override any
            bindings specified within the file if they share the same keys.

        Returns
        -------
        SQL
            An instance of the SQL class initialized with the query and bindings from the file and additional bindings provided.

        Raises
        ------
        FileNotFoundError
            If the specified file path does not exist.
        SyntaxError
            If the initial bindings in the file are not in a valid Python dictionary format.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> query = SQL.from_file('path/to/query.sql', id=123)
