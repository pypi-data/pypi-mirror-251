Part 1:
You have a Set table (Ex: Segment Set)

Nested Compute

Mesh Table: Will hold the abstract ideas
Mesh Maker: Computed Part table that has a make function:
- in charge of mapping how a segent becomes a mesh


Optimal Make method: 
1) Get items form the key
2) Run method that will turn it into object
3) Add method ouptut and key together in dictionary
4) Insert the key

Terminology: 
1) Entity: any top level table wrapping an object (Ex: Segment,Mesh)
2) ethod: Top level table that aggregates the nested methods: 
    --> nested method: single method with some parameters (there is only on thing that the table does, ex: turn segment into mesh)

3) Maker: A nested compute (ex: that makes meshes)
4) Nested Store: 



Entity A has get function that gets a single object in nested store
- nested store will have
    get
    put
    
    
With a Maker class that has: 
1) Entity A
2) Method B
2) Entity B
