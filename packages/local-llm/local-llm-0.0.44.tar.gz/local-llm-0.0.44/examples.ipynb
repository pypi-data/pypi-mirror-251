Long ago, the world had plenty of resources; oceans swarming with fish, mountains of precious stones, and meadows of wildflowers. But soon as these magical creatures started disappearing, others stepped into their habitat which changed the earth's balance forever but among all those creatures, DRAGONS always had a special place in human\\u2019s mind.\\n\\nAn enigmatic volcanic dragon named Malgoryst stood tall in an azure mountain valley surrounded by greenery as far as his mighty red and scaly eyes could see. He roamed the mountains freely, hunting for meat using nothing but his legendary nostrils and a silent fire breathing expertise. The rest of dragons used to live in harmony sharing nature\\u2019s bounties with humans, except for few misguided who became hoarders preaching Draconic philosophy that said all goods must only serve dragon's pleasure which gradually changed the dynamics among dragons with time. But our protagonist Malgoryst was a lone soul with his own philosophy who wished everybody would enjoy the earth's beauty in their own manner, living in harmony not chaos- much contrary to what the world perceived about Dragons then.\",\n",
