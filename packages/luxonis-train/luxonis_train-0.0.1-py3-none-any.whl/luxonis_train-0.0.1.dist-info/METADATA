              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

Luxonis training framework (`luxonis-train`) is intended for training deep learning models that can run fast on OAK products.

**The project is in an alpha state - please report any feedback.**

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Training](#training)
- [Customizations](#customizations)
- [Tuning](#tuning)
- [Exporting](#exporting)
- [Credentials](#credentials)
- [Contributing](#contributing)

## Installation

`luxonis-train` is hosted on PyPi and can be installed with `pip` as:

```bash
pip install luxonis-train
```

This command will also create a `luxonis_train` executable in your `PATH`.
See `luxonis_train --help` for more information.

## Usage

The entire configuration is specified in a `yaml` file. This includes the model
structure, used losses, metrics, optimizers etc. For specific instructions and example
configuration files, see [Configuration](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/configs/README.md).

### Data Preparation

This library requires data to be in the Luxonis Dataset Format.

For instructions on how to create a dataset in the LDF, follow the
[examples](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-ml/tree/main/examples) in
the [luxonis-ml](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-ml) repository.

## Training

Once you've created your `config.yaml` file you can train the model using this command:

```bash
luxonis_train train --config config.yaml
```

If you wish to manually override some config parameters you can do this by providing the key-value pairs. Example of this is:

```bash
luxonis_train train --config config.yaml trainer.batch_size 8 trainer.epochs 10
```

where key and value are space separated and sub-keys are dot (`.`) separated. If the configuration field is a list, then key/sub-key should be a number (e.g. `trainer.preprocessing.augmentations.0.name RotateCustom`).

## Tuning

To improve training performance you can use `Tuner` for hyperparameter optimization.
To use tuning, you have to specify [tuner](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/configs/README.md#tuner) section in the config file.

To start the tuning, run

```bash
luxonis_train tune --config config.yaml
```

You can see an example tuning configuration [here](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/configs/example_tuning.yaml).

## Exporting

We support export to `ONNX`, and `DepthAI .blob format` which is used for OAK cameras. By default, we export to `ONNX` format.

To use the exporter, you have to specify the [exporter](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/configs/README.md#exporter) section in the config file.

Once you have the config file ready you can export the model using

```bash
luxonis_train export --config config.yaml
```

You can see an example export configuration [here](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/configs/example_export.yaml).

## Customizations

We provide a registry interface through which you can create new
[nodes](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/luxonis_train/nodes/README.md),
[losses](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/luxonis_train/attached_modules/losses/README.md),
[metrics](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/luxonis_train/attached_modules/metrics/README.md),
[visualizers](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/luxonis_train/attached_modules/visualizers/README.md),
[callbacks](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/luxonis_train/callbacks/README.md),
[optimizers](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/configs/README.md#optimizer),
and [schedulers](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/configs/README.md#scheduler).

Registered components can be then referenced in the config file. Custom components need to inherit from their respective base classes:

- Node - [BaseNode](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/luxonis_train/models/nodes/base_node.py)
- Loss - [BaseLoss](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/luxonis_train/attached_modules/losses/base_loss.py)
- Metric - [BaseMetric](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/luxonis_train/attached_modules/metrics/base_metric.py)
- Visualizer - [BaseVisualizer](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/luxonis_train/attached_modules/visualizers/base_visualizer.py)
- Callback - [Callback from lightning.pytorch.callbacks](lightning.pytorch.callbacks)
- Optimizer - [Optimizer from torch.optim](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer)
- Scheduler - [LRScheduler from torch.optim.lr_scheduler](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate)

Here is an example of how to create a custom components:

```python
from torch.optim import Optimizer
from luxonis_train.utils.registry import OPTIMIZERS
from luxonis_train.attached_modules.losses import BaseLoss

@OPTIMIZERS.register_module()
class CustomOptimizer(Optimizer):
    ...

# Subclasses of BaseNode, LuxonisLoss, LuxonisMetric
# and BaseVisualizer are registered automatically.

class CustomLoss(BaseLoss):
    # This class is automatically registered under `CustomLoss` name.
    def __init__(self, k_steps: int, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        ...
```

And then in the config you reference this `CustomOptimizer` and `CustomLoss` by their names:

```yaml
losses:
  - name: CustomLoss
    params:  # additional parameters
      k_steps: 12

```

For more information on how to define custom components, consult the respective in-source documentation.

## Credentials

Local use is supported by default. In addition, we also integrate some cloud services which can be primarily used for logging and storing. When these are used, you need to load environment variables to set up the correct credentials.

You have these options how to set up the environment variables:

- Using standard environment variables
- Specifying the variables in a `.env` file. If a variable is both in the environment and present in `.env` file, the exported variable takes precedense.
- Specifying the variables in the [ENVIRON](https://github.com/luxonis/luxonis-train/blob/main/configs/README.md#environ) section of the config file. Note that this is not a recommended way. Variables defined in config take precedense over environment and `.env` variables.

### S3

If you are working with LuxonisDataset that is hosted on S3, you need to specify these env variables:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=**********
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=**********
AWS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=**********
```

### MLFlow

If you want to use MLFlow for logging and storing artifacts you also need to specify MLFlow-related env variables like this:

```bash
MLFLOW_S3_BUCKET=**********
MLFLOW_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=**********
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=**********
```

### WanDB

If you are using WanDB for logging, you have to sign in first in your environment.

### POSTGRESS

There is an option for remote storage for [Tuning](#tuning). We use POSTGRES and to connect to the database you need to specify the folowing env variables:

```bash
POSTGRES_USER=**********
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=**********
POSTGRES_HOST=**********
POSTGRES_PORT=**********
POSTGRES_DB=**********
```

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the development, install the dev version of the package:

```bash
pip install luxonis-train[dev]
```
