## Collaborating

Code contributions to the dlordinal project are welcomed via pull requests.
Please, contact the maintainers (maybe opening an issue) before doing any work to make sure that your contributions align with the project.

### Guidelines for code contributions

* In order to set up the environment for development, install the project in editable mode and include the optional dev requirements:
```bash
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```
* Install the pre-commit hooks before starting to make any modifications:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
* Write code that is compatible with all supported versions of Python listed in the `pyproject.toml` file.
* Create tests that cover the common cases and the corner cases of the code.
* Preserve backwards-compatibility whenever possible, and make clear if something must change.
* Document any portions of the code that might be less clear to others, especially to new developers.
* Write API documentation as docstrings.
