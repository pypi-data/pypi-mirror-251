# Azure OpenAI with Marvin
It is possible to use Azure OpenAI with _some_ of `marvin`'s functionality via:
 - passing the `AzureOpenAI` client offered in `openai` 1.x to Marvin's components
 - setting the environment variables listed below

!!! Note
    Azure OpenAI often lags behind the latest version of OpenAI in terms of functionality, therefore some features may not work with Azure OpenAI. If you encounter problems, please check that the underlying functionality is supported by Azure OpenAI before reporting an issue.

## Settings
After setting up your Azure OpenAI account and deployment, it is recommended you save these settings in your `~/.marvin/.env` file.

```bash
Â» cat ~/.marvin/.env | rg AZURE
MARVIN_USE_AZURE_OPENAI=true
MARVIN_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
MARVIN_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://<your-endpoint>.openai.azure.com/
MARVIN_AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview # or whatever is the latest
MARVIN_AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-35-turbo-0613 # or whatever you named your deployment
```

## Passing a `MarvinClient` set up with `AzureOpenAI` manually

```python
import marvin
from marvin.client import MarvinClient

from openai import AzureOpenAI

azure_openai_client = AzureOpenAI(
    api_key="my-api-key",
    azure_endpoint="https://my-endpoint.openai.azure.com/",
    api_version="2023-12-01-preview",
)

@marvin.fn(
    client=MarvinClient(client=azure_openai_client),
    model_kwargs={"model": "gpt-35-turbo-0613"}
)
def list_fruits(n: int) -> list[str]:
    """generate a list of fruits"""
```
