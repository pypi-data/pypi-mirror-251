# Simple use of kyaah
First we recommend creating a virtual environment `python -m venv venv` and then activate it `source venv/bin/activate`

Once that finish now install the library using

```sh
    pip install kyaah
```

Wait for the installation to finish, basically the library was uploaded using `sdist` (Source Distribution) and `bdist_wheel` (Built Distribution). After that create a new file let call it `test.py` in the file paste the below code with your credentials.

```python
    import kyaah
                
    sender = 'my_email@gmail.com'
    receiver = ['receiver_1@gmail.com', 'receiver_2@gmail.com']
    passwd = '*********' # use app password

    server = 'gmail'
    subj = f'Hellow world!'
    body = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet adipisicing elit, rerum voluptate ipsum volupt.'

    kyaah.sendMail(
        from_usr=sender, to_usr=receiver, svr=server, subject=subj, body=body, mail_passwd=passwd
    )
```

save the file and navigate to where the file is located in terminal and your are ready to go (run the file)

```sh
    python test.py
```
