![Enhanced Yaml File](images/enhanced_yaml_file_example.jpg)

## File Format Examples

Here's an example of what the text file (`ip_list.txt`) and the YAML file (`inventory.yml`) should look like for the Switch MAC Collector Script:

### Text Files (`ip_list.txt`)

```text
192.168.1.1
192.168.1.2
192.168.1.3
```

In the text file, each line represents an IP address of a network device. You can add as many IP addresses as needed, one per line.

### YAML File (`inventory.yml`)

```yaml
hosts:
  - ip: 192.168.1.1
  - ip: 192.168.1.2
  - host: 192.168.1.3
```

In the YAML file, you define a list of hosts under the "hosts" key. Each host in the list should have a "host" key with its corresponding IP address. You can add or remove hosts as necessary.

### Enhanced YAML File (`inventory.yaml`)

```yaml
hosts:
  - host: Switch1
    ip: 192.168.1.1
  - host: Switch2
    ip: 192.168.1.2
  - host: Switch3
    ip: 192.168.1.3
```

In this enhanced YAML file, you can also specify a "hostname" for each host in addition to the "host" key. This allows you to associate a friendly name with each IP address, making it easier to identify the devices in your network.

These files serve as input sources for the Switch MAC Collector Script, allowing you to specify the IP addresses of the network devices you want to process.
