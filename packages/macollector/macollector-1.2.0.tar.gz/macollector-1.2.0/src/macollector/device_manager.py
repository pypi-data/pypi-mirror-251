    A class that manages a collection of network devices.

    Attributes:
        devices (list[NetworkDevice]): A list of NetworkDevice objects
                                       representing the network devices.
        mac_addresses (set[str]): A set of MAC addresses collected from
                                  the network devices.
        failed_devices (list[str]): A list of IP addresses of devices
                                    that failed during processing.

    Methods:
        __init__(self, credentials, device_list) -> None:
            Initializes a DeviceManager object.
        process_all_devices(self) -> None:
            Processes all devices in the collection.

            Processes a network device to collect MAC addresses

            Extracts valid MAC addresses from a given MAC address table.

            Checks if a given string is a valid MAC address.
