Print the current context of the EVM.

Syntax: `context`

![](../../imgs/context.png)

The context is divided into different views that provide different kinds of information during debugging.

The layout of the context view is fully configurable via the `context_layout` configuration option.
The default layout is `'source,metadata,status,disass,stack,callstack'`.

It can either be set globally in the ethpwn configuration file in `~/.config/ethpwn/config.json` or on a per-debugging session basis via the `ethdbg` CLI.

```python
# set a minimal context layout for the current debugging session
ethdbgâž¤ context_layout 'disass,stack,callstack'
```

```json
// set a minimal context layout for all debugging sessions in the config.json
{
    ...
    "dbg": {
        "context_layout": "disass,stack,callstack"
        ...
    }
}
```

### ðŸ‘€ Source View
This view is displayed when the account currently executing has source code available in the `contract_registry()` or the executing contract
has verified source code available on Etherscan.

To provide source code, a user can either verify their contract source on Etherscan and provide the Etherscan API key in the configuration, or register it in `ethpwn`'s [contract registry](/ethpwn/ethpwn/global_state/#contractregistry).

```bash
# register a contract in the registry using the ethpwn CLI
$ ethpwn contract register 0x1234... MyContractName  MyContract.sol

# register a contract in the registry using the ethpwn python API
>>> from ethpwn import *
>>> CONTRACT_METADATA.compile_solidity_files(['MyContract.sol'])
>>> CONTRACT_METADATA['MyContractName'].get_contract_at('0x1234...')
```

This view highlights the currently executing source code line corresponding to the EVM opcodes displayed in the Disassembly view.

Due to the debug information produced by the Solidity and Vyper compilers, this view can become quite large for large contracts.
To avoid this, a user can either specify a maximum number of lines to display via the `source_view_cutoff` option, or by disabling the view entirely by removing it from the `context_layout`.
These settings can be set globally in the ethpwn configuration file in `~/.config/ethpwn/config.json` or on a per-debugging session basis via the `ethdbg` CLI.

### ðŸ‘€ Metadata View
The Metadata view displays useful information regarding the currently executing transaction.

| Field                     | What |
|---------------------------|----------|
| `Fork`                    | Version of the EVM currently executing |
| `Block`                   | Block number at which the current transaction is executing |
| `Origin`                  | The account that started the transaction  |
| `Current code account`    | The address of the smart contract currently executing code |
| `Current storage account` | The address of the smart contract whose storage will be referenced during an SSTORE/SLOAD |
| `Balance`                 | The balance of the Current code account |
| `Gas Used`                | The amount of gas used up until the current opcode |
| `Gas Remaining`           | How much gas is remaining for this transaction execution |


### ðŸ‘€ Disassembly View
Here we display the currently executing opcode, a small history of opcodes executed up to this point, and a short look-ahead of the following opcodes.

(You can see the full history by using the command `log_op`).

### ðŸ‘€ Stack View
A view of the currently active EVM stack.

### ðŸ‘€ Callstack View

The Callstack View provides insight regarding the nested calls that are performed by a transactions to different contracts during execution (i.e., internal transactions created by these opcodes: `CALL`, `DELEGATECALL`, `STATICCALL`, `CODECALL`, `CREATE`, `CREATE2`).
This view provides the following information:

| Field                 | What |
|-------------------|----------|
| `Address`    | The current code address executing (the target of the last-issued `CALL`/...) |
| `Call Type`  | Type of call, `CALL`, `DELEGATECALL`, `STATICCALL`, `CODECALL`, `CREATE`, `CREATE2`
| `Call Site`  | The program counter value in the caller contract when the last-call was issued
| `msg.sender` | The value of the `msg.sender` in this call-context
| `msg.value`  | The amount of ETH sent by the caller for this call-context
| `Name`       | If the contract is in the [registry](), we display its name here.
