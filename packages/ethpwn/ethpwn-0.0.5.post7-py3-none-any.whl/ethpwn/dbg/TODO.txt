EXTRAS:
1 - Telescope command and automatic abi decoding for opcodes
2 - Display if we are taking next jump or not through emulation
3 - watchpoints on storage location or memory
4 - support for multiple transactions
5 - Modifying storage and memory on demand
6 - Visualize logs
7 - merge Yon's snapshots
8 - undo command
10- ui terminal
11- Support execution of TX from top of block, end, or specific position (more advanced)
    - Executing always at the top might not work in some cases (balance of tokens for a contract)
12- Decode strings if they look like strings when printing the disassembly or the stack
13- Order sstores and sloads temporarly (otherwise it's impossible to understand in which order this things happened)
14- Probably need this to support Avalanche:

15- Collect the pre-image and show them when there is an sstore on a map/array.
16- add dynamic provenance (use-def plugin printed with rich tree)
17- add code_address:storage_address for each log in the log_op
18- add break when opcode is X and its arguments are X,Y,Z.
19- add memory watchpoints
20- disassemble by pc

PRIORITY:
1- Avoid to re-execute all the txs to bring the EVM in the right state when replay (snapshot it?) (snapshot + checkpoint)
