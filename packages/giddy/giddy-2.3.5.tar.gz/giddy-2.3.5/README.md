Giddy is an open-source python library for exploratory spatiotemporal data analysis and the analysis of geospatial distribution dynamics. It is under active development for the inclusion of newly proposed analytics that consider the role of space in the evolution of distributions over time.

*Below are six choropleth maps of U.S. state per-capita incomes from 1929 to 2004 at a fifteen-year interval.*

Documentation
--------------------

Online documentation is available [here](http://pysal.org/giddy/).


Features
------------

- Directional LISA, inference and visualization as rose diagram

[![rose_conditional](figs/rose_conditional.png)](notebooks/DirectionalLISA.ipynb)

*Above shows the rose diagram (directional LISAs) for US states incomes across 1969-2009 conditional on relative incomes in 1969.*

- Spatially explicit Markov methods:
    - Spatial Markov and inference
    - LISA Markov and inference
- Spatial decomposition of exchange mobility measure (rank methods):
    - Global indicator of mobility association (GIMA) and inference
    - Inter- and intra-regional decomposition of mobility association and inference
    - Local indicator of mobility association (LIMA)
        - Neighbor set LIMA and inference
        - Neighborhood set LIMA and inference

- Income mobility measures
- Alignment-based sequence analysis methods
