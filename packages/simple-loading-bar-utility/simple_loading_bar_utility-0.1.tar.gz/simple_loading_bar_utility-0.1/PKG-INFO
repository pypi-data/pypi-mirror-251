        ## Installation
        
        Currently, the package is not hosted on PyPI, so you can install it directly from the source:
        
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/peterdonaghey/simple_loading_bar_utility.git
        cd loading_bar
        pip install .
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        To use `loading_bar` in your project, simply import and call the function in a loop:
        
        ```python
        from loading_bar.loading_bar import loading_bar
        
        total = 1000
        
        for i in range(total):
            loading_bar(i, total)
        ```
        
        ## Customization
        
        You can customize the loading bar by adjusting the following parameters:
        
        `i`: Current iteration (int).
        
        `total`: Total iterations (int).
        
        `length`: Length of the loading bar (default is 50).
        
        `show_percentage`: Flag to show or hide percentage (default is True).
        
        `show_iterations`: Flag to show or hide iterations completed (default is True).
