## Description

These python3 utilities let you test (and simulate) a WeatherFlow station installation

They permit you to listen to UDP broadcasts from your Hub and:
 * print the received UDP broadcasts to stdout
 * print the decoded broadcasts in a more human-friendly form
 * publish derived topics to MQTT
 * publish derived topics to influxdb (v1.x and v2.x)
 * support any combination of Air/Sky/Tempest
 * support multiple instances of Air/Sky/Tempest at your site

They also provide a utility to permit you to simulate a WeatherFlow Hub with minimal test data.

NOTE - These utilities are tested using v119 of the WeatherFlow hub firmware.


## Disclaimer

These utilities are provided as-is.  Please consult the Project Home Page for more details.
