# GAML: Astrometric MicroLensing prediction using Gaia's data

This Python package searches for astrometric gravitational microlensing events
given a list of lens-source pairs, and output quality assessments and astrometric
and photometric microlensing effects of significant lensing events.

This project has evolved from [Kl√ºter's amlensing][amlensing], with the following
improvements:
- major overhaul to standardize and generalize the codebase
- substantial refactors to adapt for general lensing objects and background sources
  - E.g., allow setting their mass, mass error, and individual epochs
- makes it easier to prepare the input data files, which was abcent in the original code
- also a few bug fixes, which affects the result (most slightly)

For more detailed changes of this fork, see [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md) and
the commit log.

## What does it do

1. GAML will perform several filters to exclude lenses and sources with low quality.
2. By predicting the motion over a specific time span, GAML determines the time
and angular separation of lens-source closest approach.
3. By sampling the angular Einstein ring radius and angular separation, it calculates
the astrometric and photometric observables of the gravitational microlensing event.
   - Such as centroid shift, positive image shift, centroid shift with a luminous
     lens, and magnification.

Although there are quite some changes from the original codebase, but it is
still recommended to read [Kluter 2022][kluter] for theoretical details.
