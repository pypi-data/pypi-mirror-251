Snowflake connection helper functions

A Python library to simplify connecting to Snowflake databases by leveraging connection options specified in [SnowSQL](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowsql.html) configuration file (`~/.snowsql/config`).

**Notes**
1. Recent [snowflake-connector-python](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python) package [supports](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/releases/tag/v3.6.0) `private_key_file` as a parameter to the `connect()` function, and the ability to use [named connections](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/python-connector/python-connector-connect#connecting-using-the-connections-toml-file). Lack of these features were some of the major reasons for this package to exist. If you don't need any other functionality offered by this package then you should rely on the latest `snowflake-connector-python` package.
1. Following are some minor differences between the way `SnowSQL` interprets connection options v/s `sfconn` library:
	- `sfconn` library supports setting `SFCONN` environment variable to be used as a default connection name before searching for a default connection entry in the config file.
	- SnowSQL doesn't (yet) allow `private_key_path` to contain home-anchored paths (e.g. `~/keys/key.p8`), but `sfconn` library does
	- SnowSQL treats relative paths as relative to working directory of the running process, whereas, `sfconn` library by default evaluates relative paths as relative to the config file location. If SnowSQL-like behavior is needed, do either of the following:
		- before any other calls to `sfconn` library, include following code
			```python
			import sfconn

			sfconn.conn.relpath_anchor_is_cwd = True
			```
		- set `SFCONN_RELPATH_ANCHOR_CWD=1` environment variable

# Installation

Use Python's standard `pip` utility for installation:

```sh
pip install --upgrade sfconn
```

# Usage

## `getconn()`

**Usage:**
```python
def getconn(name: str | None, **overrides: dict[str, Any]) -> Connection
```

`getconn` accepts a connection name that is defined in `~/.snowsql/config` and returns a connection object. If connection name is `None`, value of `SFCONN` environment variable will be used as the default connection name; if `SFCONN` is unset then the default connection entry defined in the config file will be used before returning an error. Any additional parameters, which are not set to `None`, will override the values loaded from the configuration file.

**Example:**

```python
from sfconn import getconn

# assuming 'dev' is a connection defined in ~/.snowflake/config
with getconn('dev', schema='PUBLIC') as cnx:
    with cnx.cursor() as csr:
        csr.execute('SELECT CURRENT_USER()')
        print("Hello " + csr.fetchone()[0])
```

## `conn_opts()`

**Usage:**
```python
def conn_opts(name: str | None , **overrides: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]
```

`conn_opts`, returns a Python `dict` object populated with options and values. This can be useful passing as an argument to `snowflake.snowpark.Session.builder.configs()` method.

**Example:**

```python
from sfconn import conn_opts
from snowflake.snowpark import Session

# assuming 'dev' is a connection defined in ~/.snowflake/config
session = Session.builder.configs(conn_opts('dev')).create()
```

## Decorator functions

Python scripts that accept command-line parameters and use `argparse` library, can use decorator functions to further reduce boilerplate code needed for setting up common Snowflake connection options as command-line arguments

```python
def args(doc: str | None) -> Callable[[argparse.ArgumentParser], None]:
def entry() -> Callable[[Connection, ...], None]:
def entry_opts() => Callable([dict[str, Any, ...]])
```

`args()` decorator function:
1. builds an `ArgumentParser` object
1. adds common Snowflake connection options as arguments that allow overriding values specified in `~/.snowsql/config`
1. calls the decorated function with the parser object to allow adding any script specific options

`entry()` decorator function:
1. consumes standard Snowflake connection options (specified with `args()`)
1. creates a connection object
1. calls the decorated function with a connection object as first parameter and any other script specific options that were specified on command line

`entry_opts()` decorator function:
- Similar to `entry()` but passes a `dict` of options as the first parameter. This is useful for passing options to the `snowflake.snowpark.Session.builder.configs()` method

**Example:**

```python
from sfconn import args, entry

@entry
def main(con, show_account: bool):
    with con.cursor() as csr:
        csr.execute('SELECT CURRENT_USER()')
        print("Hello " + csr.fetchone()[0])
        if show_account:
            csr.execute("SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT()")
            print("You are connected to account: " + csr.fetchone()[0])

@args("Sample application that greets the current Snowflake user")
def getargs(parser):
    parser.add_argument("-a", "--show-account", action='store_true', help="show snowflake account name")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main(**vars(getargs()))
```

## `get_token()`

Function `sfconn.get_token()` returns a JWT token for connections that use `private_key_path` option. An optional lifetime value can be specified (default 54 minutes)

**Example:**

```python
from sfconn import get_token

# assuming 'dev' is a connection defined in ~/.snowflake/config and uses key-pair authentication
jwt_token = get_token('dev', 120)  # get a token valid for 120 minutes
```

# Utilities

The `sfconn` module provides a couple of handy utilities.

## list connections

To list all defined connections, use

```
python -m sfconn [list]
```

## connection options as JSON

Convert connection options to a JSON object.

```
python -m sfconn [-c <conn>] json
```

## test a connection

To test a particular connection, use

```
python -m sfconn [-c <conn>] test [--save]
```

`--save` option applies to connections that require password to be supplied. When specified, it saves the supplied password in OS specific *secure local storage*.

**Notes:**

- `--save` option is supported only if the optional python package `keyring` is installed.
- `keyring` can also be installed indirectly by installing `snowflake-connector-python` with `secure-local-storage` extra dependency as described [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/python-connector-install.html#step-1-install-the-connector)

## get a JWT

Get a JWT for connections that use key-pair authentication

```
python -m sfconn [-c <conn>] jwt [--lifetime <minutes>]
```
