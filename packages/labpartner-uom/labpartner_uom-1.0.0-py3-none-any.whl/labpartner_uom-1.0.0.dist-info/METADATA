# LabPartner - A Tool for Undergraduate Physics Students

[![PyPI package](https://img.shields.io/badge/pip%20install-labpartner_uom-brightgreen)](https://pypi.org/project/labpartner_uom/) [![version number](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/example-pypi-package?color=green&label=version)](https://github.com/SiddharthSule/labpartner_uom/releases) [![Actions Status](https://github.com/SiddharthSule/labpartner_uom/workflows/Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SiddharthSule/labpartner_uom/actions) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/SiddharthSule/labpartner_uom)](https://github.com/SiddharthSule/labpartner_uom/blob/main/LICENSE)

Struggling with Lab? Me too!

Over the course of my undergraduate studies at the University of Manchester, UK, I had three years of lab. Now, as someone who teaches those labs alongside my PhD, I thought it would be useful to automate some of the more painful parts of lab, so the students can just focus on understanding the physics and assessing their results.

This Python is Package can:
- Propagate Errors for any Function
- Apply ~Linear and Quadratic~ ANY fit to a set of Data
- Plot Results in the style of Lab Reports

It is important to acknowledge that there are other very useful tools (OriginPro, LSFR, your own code). I just wanted to try making something that works as an all-in-one system, effectively acting as a Lab Partner!

## Installation

To install this package, simply type:

```bash
pip install labpartner_uom
```
PyPI might use labpartner-uom, but this command does the same. Someday I hope to remove the '_uom'!

## Usage

The code is based on Numpy, Sympy and Matplotlib. Try to have your x, y and y error data as Numpy arrays.

### Error Propagation

To propagate errors, simply write up the function and the variables which have uncertainties.

```python
import labpartner_uom as lp
prop = lp.errorpropagator.propagate_error(func, vars)

# Example
prop = lp.errorpropagator.propagate_error("A*x**2 + B*y + C", ["x", "y"])
```

### Data Analysis

There are a few presets which allow you to auto-analyse your results.

```python
import labpartner_uom as lp
lp.analyse(x, y, yerr, fit="Linear")
```

This should print the results of the fitting, as well save a .png and .pdf of the plot.

Options of fits include: Linear, Quadratic, Gaussian, Exponential, Logarithmic, Sine, Cosine and more! You can also add your own functions to fit (see below for details)

## Advanced Options - For those who want more Customisation

### Function Fitting

```python
import labpartner_uom as lp
fit = lp.fit.do_fit(lp.fit.do_fit(x, y, func, p0=p0, yerr=yerr)

# Example
my_func = "a * sin(x) + b"
fit = lp.fit.do_fit([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], my_func, p0=[1, 1], yerr=[1, 1, 1])
```

### (OLD) Linear and Quadratic Fit

```python
import labpartner_uom as lp
fit = lp.linfit.do_linear_fit(x, y, yerr)
fit = lp.quadfit.do_quadratic_fit(x, y, yerr)


# Example
fit = lp.linfit.do_linear_fit([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [0.2, 0.2, 0.3])
fit = lp.quadfit.do_quadratic_fit([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [0.2, 0.2, 0.3])
```

### Plotting

```python
import labpartner_uom as lp
lp.plotter.plot(x, y, yerr=None, xlabel="x axis", ylabel="y axis", title=None, label="data", fit_type=None, figsize=(4, 3))

# Example
lp.plotter.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [0.2, 0.2, 0.3])
```
