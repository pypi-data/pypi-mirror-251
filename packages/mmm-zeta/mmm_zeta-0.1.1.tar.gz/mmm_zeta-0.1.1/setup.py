MultiModalMamba is built on Zeta, a minimalist yet powerful AI framework, designed to streamline and enhance machine learning model management. \n\nThe capacity to process and interpret multiple data types concurrently is essential, the world isn\'t 1dimensional. MultiModalMamba addresses this need by leveraging the capabilities of Vision Transformer and Mamba, enabling efficient handling of both text and image data. This makes MultiModalMamba a versatile solution for a broad spectrum of AI tasks. MultiModalMamba stands out for its significant speed and efficiency improvements over traditional transformer architectures, such as GPT-4 and LLAMA. This enhancement allows MultiModalMamba to deliver high-quality results without sacrificing performance, making it an optimal choice for real-time data processing and complex AI algorithm execution. A key feature of MultiModalMamba is its proficiency in processing extremely long sequences.\n\nThis capability is particularly beneficial for tasks that involve substantial data volumes or necessitate a comprehensive understanding of context, such as natural language processing or image recognition. With MultiModalMamba, you\'re not just adopting a state-of-the-art AI model. You\'re integrating a fast, efficient, and robust tool that is equipped to meet the demands of contemporary AI tasks. Experience the power and versatility of Multi Modal Mamba - MultiModalMamba now!\n\n## Install\n`pip3 install mmm-zeta`\n\n\n## Usage\n\n### `MultiModalMambaBlock`\n\n\n```python\n# Import the necessary libraries\nimport torch  # Import the torch library\n\n# Import the MultiModalMamba model from the mm_mamba module\nfrom mm_mamba import MultiModalMamba\n\n# Generate a random tensor \'x\' of size (1, 224) with random elements between 0 and 10000\nx = torch.randint(0, 10000, (1, 196))\n\n# Generate a random image tensor \'img\' of size (1, 3, 224, 224)\nimg = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)\n\n# Audio tensor \'aud\' of size 2d\naud = torch.randn(1, 224)\n\n# Video tensor \'vid\' of size 5d - (batch_size, channels, frames, height, width)\nvid = torch.randn(1, 3, 16, 224, 224)\n\n# Create a MultiModalMamba model object with the following parameters:\nmodel = MultiModalMamba(\n    vocab_size=10000,\n    dim=512,\n    depth=6,\n    dropout=0.1,\n    heads=8,\n    d_state=512,\n    image_size=224,\n    patch_size=16,\n    encoder_dim=512,\n    encoder_depth=6,\n    encoder_heads=8,\n    fusion_method="mlp",\n    return_embeddings=False,\n    post_fuse_norm=True,\n)\n\n# Pass the tensor \'x\' and \'img\' through the model and store the output in \'out\'\nout = model(x, img, aud, vid)\n\n# Print the shape of the output tensor \'out\'\nprint(out.shape)\n\n\n# After much training\n\nmodel.eval()\n\n# Generate text\nmodel.generate(text)\n\n```\n\n\n### `MultiModalMamba`, Ready to Train Model\n- Flexibility in Data Types: The MultiModalMamba model can handle both text and image data simultaneously. This allows it to be trained on a wider variety of datasets and tasks, including those that require understanding of both text and image data.\n\n- Customizable Architecture: The MultiModalMamba model has numerous parameters such as depth, dropout, heads, d_state, image_size, patch_size, encoder_dim, encoder_depth, encoder_heads, and fusion_method. These parameters can be tuned according to the specific requirements of the task at hand, allowing for a high degree of customization in the model architecture.\n\n- Option to Return Embeddings: The MultiModalMamba model has a return_embeddings option. When set to True, the model will return the embeddings instead of the final output. This can be useful for tasks that require access to the intermediate representations learned by the model, such as transfer learning or feature extraction tasks.\n\n```python\nimport torch  # Import the torch library\n\n# Import the MultiModalMamba model from the mm_mamba module\nfrom mm_mamba import MultiModalMamba\n\n# Generate a random tensor \'x\' of size (1, 224) with random elements between 0 and 10000\nx = torch.randint(0, 10000, (1, 196))\n\n# Generate a random image tensor \'img\' of size (1, 3, 224, 224)\nimg = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)\n\n# Create a MultiModalMamba model object with the following parameters:\nmodel = MultiModalMamba(\n    vocab_size=10000,\n    dim=512,\n    depth=6,\n    dropout=0.1,\n    heads=8,\n    d_state=512,\n    image_size=224,\n    patch_size=16,\n    encoder_dim=512,\n    encoder_depth=6,\n    encoder_heads=8,\n    fusion_method="mlp",\n    return_embeddings=False,\n    post_fuse_norm=True,\n)\n\n# Pass the tensor \'x\' and \'img\' through the model and store the output in \'out\'\nout = model(x, img)\n\n# Print the shape of the output tensor \'out\'\nprint(out.shape)\n\n\n# After much training\nmodel.eval()\n\n# Tokenize texts\ntext_tokens = tokenize(text)\n\n# Send text tokens to the model\nlogits = model(text_tokens)\n\ntext = detokenize(logits)\n```\n\n# Real-World Deployment\n\nAre you an enterprise looking to leverage the power of AI?
