How to use
==========

The main functionality is running a search on a provided stream of data. The suggested use of the pipeline is running the `search.py` script with appropriate options through terminal as it will be shown below.



**MLy** provides a series of tutorials that will help you understand how to use the package. MLy can help you do two main things. 

- Create datasets using the various :doc:`generator tools <tutorials.generator>`, that are related to gravitational wave data or not.
- :doc:`PlugIns <tutorials.plugins>`, to create and add your own extra features on the datasets you have already created, that fit to your own problem.
- :doc:`Tools to test <tutorials.validation>` a trained algorithm, assuming you trained a machine learning algorithm (see :doc:`here <tutorials.training>` for a simple example using keras).
