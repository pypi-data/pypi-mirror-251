# napari-orientationpy

Analyze orientations in 2D, 3D, and RGB images in Napari. This plugin is based on the [Orientationpy](https://gitlab.com/epfl-center-for-imaging/orientationpy/) project.

## Installation

You can install `napari-orientationpy` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-orientationpy

## Usage
To get started, open an image in the Napari viewer and start `napari-orientationpy` from the `Plugins` menu:

```
Plugins > Napari Orientationpy > Orientation measurement
```

1. **Select the structural scale parameter `sigma`**. This value control represents the scale at which the image gradients are computed. Try different values of `sigma` to understand what works best for your images. A reasonable guess would be the order in size, in pixels, of the structures that you are interested in. For example, if you are imaging fibers that appear to be about 4 pixels wide, try to set a value of *sigma=4*.

2. **If you are analyzing a 3D image, select `fiber` or `membrane` mode**. In `fiber` mode, the orientation normals follow fibrous structures. In `membrane` mode, the orientations are normal to the surface of membranous structures.

3. **Decide which outputs you'd like to visualize.**
  - The `color-coded orientation` is a pixel-wise representation of 3D orientations as colors (similar colors = similar orientations).
  - The `orientation vectors` get rendered in a `Vectors` layer in Napari. They are sampled on a regular grid defined by the `Spacing (X)`, `Spacing (Y)` and `Spacing (Z)` values (for 2D images, the `Z` value is ignored). The length of the vectors can be rescaled based on the `energy` value of the orientation computation.
  - You can also output the local `orientation gradient` (misorientation).

4. **Compute orientation**. This button will trigger the orientation computation **only when necessary** (i.e. when the value of `sigma`, the `mode` or the `image` have changed). If you only adjust the `orientation vectors` parameters, clicking the compute button will update the results very fast.
5. **Save orientation (CSV)**. This will save the orientation measurements as a CSV table with columns `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `theta`, `phi`, `energy`, and `coherency` for all the pixels in the image. 

### Plotting the 3D orientation distribution

If you have computed **orientation vectors** for a 3D image, you can plot their spatial distribution as a `stereographic projection` along the `X`, `Y` or `Z` direction directly in Napari. Select the widget from:

```
Plugins > Napari Orientationpy > Orientation distribution (3D)
```
