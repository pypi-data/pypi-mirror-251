priorities:

	ordered:
		most important:
		
			[ ] if "exit ()" is called by a process,
				this might cause a problem...
		
			[ ] put the status checks in the module.
					# mechsuit checks
					
					vivacious
						_status
						
					import vivacious._status as vivacious_status
					vivacious_status.check ()
				
			[ ] [SH] mechsuit shares
			
			
			[ ] capture process journal:
			
					This might have binary
					
					Could try utf8, the if doesn't
					work could try hex
					
					journal: [{
						"UTF8": {
							"parseable": "no"
						},
						"hex": ""
					},{
						"UTF8": {
							"parseable": "yes"
							"string": "journal entry"
						}
					},{
						"UTF8": {
							"parseable": "yes"
							"string": "journal entry"
						}
					}]
				
		
			[ ] "checks" or "courses"
		
			[ ] The unit_tests from body_scan
				need to be rewritten as body_scan tests
				for vivacious.
				
			[ ]	global option to repeat checks if they fail,
				since there are possibilites like "deadlocks"
			
			[ ] mkdir -p, db_directory
		
			[ ] print the passed checks history numbers in the results.
			
					status checks [113 to 103]: [45][43][43][42][40]

					#
					#	That way can easily notice if that number decreases
					#	suddenly for some reason.
					#	
			
			
			[ ] Somehow showing processes that are still in progress,
				in the event that one doesn't stop ever or something.
			
			[ ]	A way to start multiple globs.			
			
				scan = vivacious.start_s2 (
					#
					#	run globs simultaneously or 
					#
					"simultaneous": "yes",
					
					"scans": [{			
						#
						#	required
						#
						"glob_string": glob_string,
						
						#
						#	optional
						#
						"name": "vitals",
						"simultaneous": "yes",
						"module_paths": [],
						"relative_path": chassis
					}]
				)
		
		
		not as important:
			[ ] websockets to vue frontend
				pypi "websockets"

	unordered:
		(body scan priorities might have more)
