$ semser author 145341374 --limit 50
```

You can also search for a paper by its Semantic Scholar ID, or by its DOI, or just use the url from semantic scholar.

```
$ semser paper "10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735"

Since it is made with typer, you can also just type
    
```
$ semser --help
$ semser search --help
