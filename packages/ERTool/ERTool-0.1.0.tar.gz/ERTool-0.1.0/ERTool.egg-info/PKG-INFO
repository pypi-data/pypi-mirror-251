Description: # ERTool
        
        ERTool is a Python package designed for simple and efficient implementation of Evidential Reasoning (ER) methods. It aims to provide an intuitive and flexible approach for integrating ER processes, particularly suitable for data analysis, clinical research, and decision support systems.
        
        ## Features
        
        - Easy-to-use implementation of Evidential Reasoning.
        - Efficient in handling complex ER tasks.
        - Flexible interface suitable for various application scenarios.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install ERTool directly from PyPI using pip:
        
        ```
        pip install ertool
        ```
        
        ## Quick Start
        Here is a basic usage example of ERTool:
        
        ```
        from ertool import ER
        import numpy as np
        
        er = ER()
        B = np.zeros(5)
        W = np.array([0.2, 0.3, 0.5])
        DBF = np.array([[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], 
                        [0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2], 
                        [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]])
        numOfChildren = 3
        numOfGrades = 4
        
        if er.er_algorithm(B, W, DBF, numOfChildren, numOfGrades):
            print("Result:", B)
        else:
            print("An error occurred during the execution of the algorithm.")
        ```
