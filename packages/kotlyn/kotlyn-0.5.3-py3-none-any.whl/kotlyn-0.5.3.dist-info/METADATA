**Note:** If you plan on making a big and serious project, Kotlyn is not the library you are looking for. For big projects you probably want to use [gradle](https://gradle.org/install/#manually). While the `kotlinc` (the library which Kotlyn is based on) is pretty powerful, it's nowhere near as useful as gradle.

# Kotlyn
> **CURRENTLY WINDOWS ONLY!**<br>
> If everything goes as planned the unix based version will be out by May 2024.<br>

Kotlyn is a toolkit to build and run Kotlin appications from the command line. This "python package" hijacks the pypi package manager/distributor to install Kotlin's latest version on your system. Apart from installing JetBrain's `kotlinc` terminal tool, Kotlyn provides a ‚ú® **new and shiny CLI** ‚ú® to run and build kotlin files.


## Installation Guide
It's really easy, don't worry! 

1. **Make sure python üêç is installed**
```powershell
python --version
```

2. **Use pip to install the CLI**
```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade kotlyn
```

3. **Run the setup**
```powershell
python -m kotlyn !setup
```

4. **Check if the installation is correct ‚úÖ**<br>
Once the setup is installed, you can just use the `kotlyn` keyword to access the CLI.
```powershell
kotlyn !version
```

## Usage
> **CURRENTLY ALL `.KT` FILES IN THE ENTRY FILE'S DIR ARE LINKED & COMPILED** <br>
*A fix/feature is on the way*

After runing the setup command, you are able to use the shorthand `kotlyn` instead of `python -m kotlyn`.

### Run a kotlin (`.kt`) file
This will build the `.jar` file in kotlyn's temp folder and will automatically delete it after the program has finished.

To run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è the `Main.kt`  just do
```powershell
kotlyn Main.kt
```

### Build the `Main.jar` file
This will build the `Main.jar` file in the same directory where your entry kotlin file is located.

To build üõ†Ô∏è the `Main.kt` into `Main.jar` just do
```powershell
kotlyn --build Main.kt
```
