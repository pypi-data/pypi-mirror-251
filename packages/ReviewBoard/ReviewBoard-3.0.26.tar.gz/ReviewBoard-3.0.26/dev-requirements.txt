# As of p4python 2021.1.2128019, there are only compiled wheel packages for
# Python 2.7 and 3.6 through 3.9. p4python's setup.py doesn't support
# automatically locating p4api or OpenSSL on anything but Linux. We have to
# wire off # Python 3.10 support for now when not running on Linux.
#
# We also have to wire off p4python entirely on Apple M1 for now, as neither
# p4python nor p4api are available for the arch64 architecture.
