"""Integrations support for Review Board.

This module provides the Review Board functionality needed to create
integrations for third-party services. It builds upon Djblets's integrations
foundation, offering some additional utilities for more easily creating
manageable integrations.

The functions and classes used in this module are deprecated. Consumers should
use the versions in :py:mod:`reviewboard.integrations.base` instead.
