 *
 * Model Attributes:
 *     caption (string):

 *
 *     renderedInline (boolean):
 *         Whether or not the comment is rendered inline.
 *
 *     reviewRequest (RB.ReviewRequest):
 *         The review request that the object being reviewed is associated
 *         with.
 *
 *     review (RB.Review):
 *         The current review that new comments will be added to.
 *
 *     serializedCommentBlocks (Array of object):
 *         Serialized comment blocks.
