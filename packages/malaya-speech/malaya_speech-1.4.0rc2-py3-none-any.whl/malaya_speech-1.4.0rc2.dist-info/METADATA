**Malaya-Speech** is a Speech-Toolkit library for bahasa Malaysia, powered by Tensorflow and PyTorch.

Documentation
--------------

Stable released documentation is available at https://malaya-speech.readthedocs.io/

Installing from the PyPI
----------------------------------

::

    $ pip install malaya-speech

It will automatically install all dependencies except for Tensorflow and PyTorch. So you can choose your own Tensorflow CPU / GPU version and PyTorch CPU / GPU version.

Only **Python >= 3.6.0**, **Tensorflow >= 1.15.0**, and **PyTorch >= 1.10** are supported.

Development Release
---------------------------------

Install from `master` branch,
::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/huseinzol05/malaya-speech.git


We recommend to use **virtualenv** for development.
