"""
Diarize an audio file using pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1

Notes
-----
- Real-time factor is around 2.5% using one Nvidia Tesla V100 SXM2 GPU (for the neural
inference part) and one Intel Cascade Lake 6248 CPU (for the clustering part).
In other words, it takes approximately 1.5 minutes to process a one hour conversation.

- The technical details of the model are described in
 https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.0

- pyannote/speaker-diarization allows setting a number of speakers to detect. Could be
viable to analyze different subsections of the video, detect the number of faces, and
use that as the number of speakers to detect.
