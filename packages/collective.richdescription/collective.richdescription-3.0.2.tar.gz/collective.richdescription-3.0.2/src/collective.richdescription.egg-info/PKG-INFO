Introduction
============

Adds the new HTML-formatable textfield ``richdescription`` content types can use.

There are two behaviors provided:

``collective.richdescription``
    The single ``richdescription`` field.

``collective.richdescription.basic``
    A drop-in replacement for ``plone.basic``. This is what you usually want: Disable plone Basic and enable this.

``collective.richdescription.optionaltitle``
    A special replacement for ``plone.basic``, but with an non-required title. To be used i.e. with file and image.

- When the field is saved, the contents are also stored in the classic dublincore ``description`` field, but without html-formatting.
- A metadata index is provided, so that ``richdescription`` can be read directly from catalog brains.
- A module global ``collective.richdescription.behavior.PATTERN_OPTIONS`` is used to configure the widget,
  It comes with a reduced set of features and can be patched if more are needed.
  There is no control panel yet (contributions are welcome).

There is **no** ``folder_listing`` or similar template yet.
If you want to have HTML formatted descriptions in ``folder_listing`` use something like this:

.. code-block:: XML

    <tal:block
      tal:define="item_description item/richdescription|nothing;
                  item_description python:item_description or item.Description;">
      <p class="akaDescription"
        tal:condition="item_description"
        tal:content="structure item_description">DESCRIPTION</p>
    </tal:block>


Warning
=======

Although there are no big issues with this package, use it at your own risk!
The description field wasn't meant to hold HTML data.
People may tend to write long essays in the description field, which is not what you want, probably.
Some use cases require this functionality though, so have fun.


Migration?
==========

There should be no need for a specific migration step.
When no richdescription field is available for a content type, it falls back to the normal description field.
When saving a content type, the richdescription field is set and the catalog's metadata richdescription column is filled.


Compatibility
=============

Tested with Plone 6
