    """
    Calculate the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) vs. treated curve at various
    decision thresholds.

    This function computes NNT, an important metric in medical decision making,
    across different thresholds of a binary classifier, allowing for analysis
    within a specified range of treated patients.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    y_true : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        True binary labels.
    y_score : ndarray of shape (n_samples,)
        Predicted probabilities or decision function outputs from a classifier.
    rho : float
        Effect size of the intervention, between 0 and 1.
    pos_label : int, float, bool, str, default=None
        The label of the positive class in binary classification.
    sample_weight : ndarray of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Weights for samples.
    min_treated : int, default=None
        Minimum number of treated patients to consider in the curve.
    max_treated : int, default=None
        Maximum number of treated patients to consider in the curve.

    Returns:
    -------
    treated : ndarray
        Array of the number of treated patients at each threshold.
    NNT : ndarray
        Number Needed to Treat at each threshold.
    thresholds : ndarray
        Evaluated thresholds.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> y_true = [0, 1, 0, 1]
    >>> y_score = [0.1, 0.4, 0.35, 0.8]
    >>> rho = 0.5

    Calculate the net benefit curve of a binary classifier across a range of

        True binary labels.

    sample_weight : ndarray of shape (n_samples,), default=None
        Weights for samples.
    min_threshold : float, default=0.0
        Minimum threshold value to include in the analysis.
    max_threshold : float, default=1.0
        Maximum threshold value to include in the analysis.

    Returns:
