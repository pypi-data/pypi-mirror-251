  r"""Returns a Lebedev quadrature grid.

  A Lebedev quadrature is a numerical approximation to the surface integral of
  a function :math:`f` over the unit sphere

  .. math::
    \int_{\Omega} f(\Omega) d\Omega \approx 4\pi \sum_{i=1}^N w_i f(\vec{r}_i)

  where :math:`\vec{r}_i` and :math:`w_i` are grid points and weights,
  respectively. A Lebedev rule of precision :math:`p` can be used to correctly
  integrate any polynomial for which the highest degree term :math:`x^iy^jz^k`
  satisfies :math:`i+j+k \leq p`.

  Args:
    precision: The desired minimum precision :math:`p`. The returned Lebedev
      rule will be the smallest grid that has the desired precision (if this
      value is not ``None``, ``num`` must be set to ``None``).
    num: The desired maximum number of points :math:`N`. The returned Lebedev
      rule will be the highest-precision grid that has not more than ``num``
      points (if this value is not ``None``, ``precision`` must be set to
      ``None``).

  Returns:
    A tuple of two arrays representing the grid points :math:`\vec{r}_i` and
    weights :math:`w_i`.

  Raises:
    ValueError:
      If both ``precision`` and ``num`` are ``None`` (or both are specified at
      the same time).
    RuntimeError:
      If the Lebedev quadrature rules cannot be loaded from disk.
