# Codelink

Codelink is a node-based visual programming environment that can be easily and flexibly integrated into 
[PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/) applications as a widget. With Codelink, functions (so-called nodes) can 
be logically linked to each other via wires, as in flowcharts, to create directed node graphs that can be used to 
perform complex calculations or control other programs. A main application area is node-based modeling of 3D geometries 
with the parametric CAD software [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/).

It provides:
* customizable nodes, sockets and data types
* framing and commenting nodes
* sub-graphs and group nodes
* socket options
* validation node connections (links)
* full undo/redo implementation
* framework for node developer
* easy integration in [PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/) applications
* made for [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)

## Installation
Binary wheels for [codelink](https://pypi.org/project/codelink/) are available on 
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/).  
```
pip install codelink
```

## Run
After installing Codelink via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) start your Python interpreter and run the following commands:
```
>>> import codelink.path_loader
>>> from codelink.app import main
>>> main()
```

If you want to run Codelink from within [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/), execute the following commands in the 
integrated Python interpreter:
```
>>> import codelink.path_loader
>>> from codelink.app_fc import main
>>> main()
```
