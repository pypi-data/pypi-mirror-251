Note Client can automate the posting of articles on note. The content of the articles is written using Markdown notation.  

We are currently releasing a beta version. In the beta version, you can use major headings, minor headings, bullet points, paragraph numbers, and horizontal lines. With future updates, customization such as bold text and quotations as well as the insertion of tables of contents will be available.

Note Client's source code is made available under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Mr-SuperInsane/NoteClient/blob/main/LICENSE).
