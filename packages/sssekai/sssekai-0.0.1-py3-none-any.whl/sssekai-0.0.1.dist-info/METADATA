                            This crypto applies to:
                                - API request/response body dumped by packet sniffer (mitmproxy, wireshark, etc.)
                                - AssetBundleInfo (can be found at /sdcard/Android/data/com.hermes.mk.asia/files/data/AssetBundleInfo,or see sssekai.abcache)
        abdecrypt           Decrypt Sekai AssetBundle
                            These can be found at /sdcard/Android/data/com.hermes.mk.asia/files/data/                                             
        usmdemux            Demux Sekai USM Video in a AssetBundle

                            NOTE: The assets can take quite a lot of space (est. 27GB) so be prepared
                            NOTE: The AssetBundles cached are NOT OBFUSCATED. They can be used as is by various Unity ripping tools (and sssekai by extension)
                                  that supports stripped Unity version (should be 2020.3.21f1).
        live2dextract       Extract Sekai Live2D Models in a AssetBundle
