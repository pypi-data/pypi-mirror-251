# OpenAI Assistant API Wrapper: Enhance Your Workflow with Ease

Welcome to this GitHub repository, where we offer an efficient and user-friendly wrapper for OpenAI's Assistant API. 

Our journey began when we encountered numerous production challenges that extended beyond the current capabilities of the Assistant API. The most pressing issue we faced was file management. This wrapper simplifies complex tasks such as uploading files, verifying uploads, deciding when to re-upload, and deleting files, among others. It's designed to streamline your workflow and handle file interactions seamlessly.

Another key feature of this wrapper is the streamlined management of Assistants. We understand the need for a hassle-free process to create, update, delete, and list Assistants. This tool was born out of a necessity to organize and maintain a clear record of Assistants, eliminating the clutter of unused and duplicate entries.

Our goal is to enhance your experience with the OpenAI Assistant API, making it more intuitive and less time-consuming. Dive into our repository and discover how you can elevate your productivity today!
