        """
        Marker object of a layer.
        Args:
            chapter (str): A text chapter link for this marker. Chapter links initiate
                           a jump to a chapter in a QuickTime movie or in other formats
                           that support chapter marks.
            comment (str): A text comment for this marker. This comment appears in the
                           Timeline panel next to the layer marker.
            cue_point_name (str): The Flash Video cue point name, as shown in the Marker
                                  dialog box.
            duration (float): The marker's duration, in seconds.
            navigation (bool): Whether the marker is a navigation marker.
            frame_target (str): A text frame target for this marker. Together with the
                                URL value, this targets a specific frame within a Web
                                page.
            url (str): A URL for this marker. This URL is an automatic link to a Web
                       page.
            label (Aep.MarkerLabel): The label color. Colors are represented by their
                                     number (0 for None, or 1 to 16 for one of the
                                     preset colors in the Labels preferences).
            protected_region (bool): State of the Protected Region option in the
                                     Composition Marker dialog box. When true, the
                                     composition marker behaves as a protected region.
                                     Will also return true for protected region markers
                                     on nested composition layers, but is otherwise not
                                     applicable to layer markers.
            params (dict[str, str]): Key-value pairs for Flash Video cue-point
                                     parameters.
            frame_duration (int): The marker's duration, in frames.
            frame_time (int): The time of the marker, in frames.
