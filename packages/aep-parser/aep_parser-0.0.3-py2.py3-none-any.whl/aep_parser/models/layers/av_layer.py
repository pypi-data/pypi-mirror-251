        """
        An AVLayer object represents an audiovisual layer within a composition.
        Args:
            adjustment_layer (bool): When true, the layer is an adjustment layer.
            audio_enabled (bool): When true, the layer's audio is enabled. This value
                                  corresponds to the audio toggle switch in the Timeline
                                  panel.
            blending_mode (int): The blending mode of the layer. See Blending modes.
            collapse_transformation (bool): True if collapse transformation is on for
                                            this layer.
            effects_active (bool): True if the layer's effects are active, as indicated
                                   by the <f> icon next to it in the user interface.
            environment_layer (bool): True if this is an environment layer in a
                                      Ray-traced 3D composition. Setting this attribute
                                      to true automatically makes the layer 3D
                                      (three_d_layer becomes true).
            frame_blending (bool): True if frame blending is enabled for this layer.
            frame_blending_type (Aep.FrameBlendingType): The type of frame blending to
                                                         perform when frame blending is
                                                         enabled for the layer.
            guide_layer (bool): True if the layer is a guide layer.
            height (float): The height of the layer in pixels.
            motion_blur (bool): True if motion blur is enabled for the layer.
            preserve_transparency (bool): True if preserve transparency is enabled for
                                         the layer.
            quality (Aep.LayerQuality): The layer's draft quality setting.
            sampling_quality (Aep.SamplingQuality): The layer's sampling method
            source_id (int): The ID of the source item for this layer. None for a text
                             layer
            three_d_layer (bool): True if this layer is a 3D layer.
            time_remap_enabled (bool): True if time remapping is enabled for this layer.
            track_matte_type (Aep.TrackMatteType): Specifies the way the track matte is
                                                   applied
            width (int): The width of the layer in pixels.
