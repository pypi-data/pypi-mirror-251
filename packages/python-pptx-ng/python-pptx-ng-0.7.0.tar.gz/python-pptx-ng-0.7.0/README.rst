*python-pptx-ng* is a Python library for creating, reading, and updating PowerPoint (.pptx)
files.

This library is a continuation of the work done by Steve Canny (scanny) on the
`python-pptx`_ project. The original project is no longer maintained and has been
forked to continue development.

A typical use would be generating a PowerPoint presentation from dynamic content such as
a database query, analytics output, or a JSON payload, perhaps in response to an HTTP
request and downloading the generated PPTX file in response. It runs on any Python
capable platform, including macOS and Linux, and does not require the PowerPoint
application to be installed or licensed.

It can also be used to analyze PowerPoint files from a corpus, perhaps to extract search
indexing text and images.

In can also be used to simply automate the production of a slide or two that would be
tedious to get right by hand, which is how this all got started.
