# nice_colorsys

This is a very small library that may offer a nicer way of working with and
converting between color systems than the default Python colorsys library.

In this library, a color in each supported color system is represented as a
`namedtuple` with `to_` methods for converting to different color systems.

## Supported color systems

* RGB (0.0&ndash;1.0)
* RGB (0&ndash;255) (via [rgb255.py](rgb255.py))
* HLS
* HSV
* YIQ
* HSLuv (via [nice_hsluv.py](nice_hsluv.py))

## Example

```python
from nice_colorsys import *

print(hsv(0.5, 1, 1).to_hls())

# Output:
#
# hls(hue=0.5, lightness=0.5, saturation=1.0)
```
