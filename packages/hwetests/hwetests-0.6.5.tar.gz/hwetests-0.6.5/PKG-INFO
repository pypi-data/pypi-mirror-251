        The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) assumption is essential to many population genetics models, which assumes that allele pairs from a given population are random. An HWE test needs to test whether the pairing are random or not.
        
        Our python package contains three statistical tests for HWE testing:
        - **ASTA**
        - **UMAT**
        - **UMAT with sampling**
        
        Both  **ASTA** and **UMAT with sampling** assume ambiguity in the allele pairing while **UMAT** does not assume ambiguity.

        ## Installation
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install hwetests.
        ```bash
        pip install hwetests
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Here we show how to use our package with simulated data.
        
        ### Create data
        
        ### ASTA
        ```python
        from hwetests import asta
        
        # returns 'words'
        foobar.pluralize('word')
        
        # returns 'geese'
        foobar.pluralize('goose')
        
        # returns 'phenomenon'
        foobar.singularize('phenomena')
        ```
        
        ## Tests
        
        Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
