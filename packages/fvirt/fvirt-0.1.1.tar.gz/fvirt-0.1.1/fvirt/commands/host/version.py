Print the host system libvirt version information.

This will output two lines, one for the libvirt version on the target
host, and one for the underlying hypervisor version.

For client-only drivers, the libvirt version should match the local
libvirt version. For other drivers, it should be the version of the
libvirtd instance you are connecting to.

Depending on the hypervisor driver in use, the hypervisor version may not
be reported, in which case this command will show a version of UNKNOWN.
