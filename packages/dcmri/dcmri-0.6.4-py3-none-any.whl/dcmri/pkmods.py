        PS (float): Permeability-Surface area product of the capillary wall, in units of mL plasma per sec and per mL tissue (mL/sec/mL or 1/sec). Physically PS is the volume of plasma fully cleared of indicator per unit of time by a unit of tissue.
        Te (float): Mean transit time of the extravascular, extracellular space, in units of sec.
        t (array_like, optional): the time points in sec of the input function *ca*. If *t* is not provided, the time points are assumed to be uniformly spaced with spacing *dt*. Defaults to None.
        dt (float, optional): spacing in seconds between time points for uniformly spaced time points. This parameter is ignored if *t* is explicity provided. Defaults to 1.0.
        sum (bool, optional): if set to True, the total concentration is returned. If set to False, the concentration in the compartments are returned separately. Defaults to True.

If sum=False this is the concentration in each compartment, and at each time point, as a 2D array with dimensions *(2,k)*, where 2 is the number of compartments and *k* is the number of time points in *ca*. The concentration is returned in units of M.

        Calculate the outfluxes:
        
        >>> J = dc.flux_2cfm(ca, Fp, vp, PS, Te, t)
