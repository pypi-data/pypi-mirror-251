## How to Find your DB Legends files
this requires android or a jailbroken iphone
so you will need to install [Zarchiver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.zdevs.zarchiver&pli=1) after you do that you will follow this path:
/Android/data/com.bandainamcoen.dblegends_ww/files/
then you will want to find this file:
89bb4eb5637df3cd96c463a795005065

after that you will put it in the folder you are using this module in and use one of the commands (see the help command by using: python dblmapi_cli.py -h)

## installnation
`pip install dblmapi-py`
