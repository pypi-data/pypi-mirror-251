# Competitions

Create a machine learning competition for your organization, friends or the world!

## Getting Started

There are two types of competitions you can create:

- generic: a competition where you provide the data and the participants provide the predictions as a CSV file. all the test data is always available to the participants.

- script: a competition where you provide the data and the participants provide the code that generates the predictions. test data can be hidden from the participants.

## Costs

Creating a competition is free. However, you will need to pay for the compute resources used to run the competition. The cost of the compute resources depends the type of competition you create.

- generic: generic competitions are free to run. you can, however, upgrade the compute to cpu-basic to speed up the metric calculation and reduce the waiting time for the participants.

- script: script competitions require a compute resource to run the participant's code. you can choose between a variety of cpu and gpu instances (T4, A10g and even A100). the cost of the compute resource is charged per hour.

For information on the cost of the compute resources, please see the [pricing page](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-overview#hardware-resources).

## Visibility

You can choose to make your competition public or private. Public competitions are visible to everyone and anyone can participate. Private competitions are only visible to the people you invite!
