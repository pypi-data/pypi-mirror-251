# remove_quarantine pypi package

A package that on install removes quarantine bit from Indigo installed Plugins


Usage:  Should be used behind the scenes to remove quarantine plugin related issues

The package consists of very little, but on pip3 install remove_quarantine will run a script to remove quarantine bit from Indigo plugin packages

Simply having this in the requirements.txt file means with every pip3 install of this library all current indigoPlugin bundles within Plugin and Plugin (Disabled) folders are unquarantined.  This includes the current folder which is having libraries install into it.
In my test this completely resolves the binary quarantine issue.

It is hard coded to Indigo version through lack of any possible other approach.  Hence will need new releases with Major Indigo version changes.

## Installation

To install the package, run:

```python
pip3 install remove_quarantine==2023.2
```
With version here equally the Indigo version you wish to apply to.

## Usage

Here's how you can use the package:

Add it to requirements.txt

requirements.txt
`remove_quarantine==2023.2`

No import in code needed.   No further code needed.

Version number == Indigo version number

## Other usage

Below is not needed, simply have this in the requirements.txt file means with every pip3 install of this library all current indigoPlugin bundles within Plugin and Plugin (Disabled) folders are unquarantined.  This includes the current folder which is having libraries install into it.
In my test this completely resolves the binary quarantine issue.

```python
from remove_quarantine import remove_quarantine, show_logging
print(show_logging()) ## Will display logging of installation removal of quarantine bits

results_remove = remove_quarantine()
print(results_remove)
## Will re-run the quarantine removal process and print the results from this.
```


```python
pip3 remove_quarantine
```
