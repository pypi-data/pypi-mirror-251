## Description

Generative AI models have shown tremendous usefulness in increasing
accessibility and automation of a wide range of tasks. Yet, their application to
the biomedical domain is still limited, in part due to the lack of a common
framework for deploying, testing, and evaluating the diverse models and
auxiliary technologies that are needed.  This repository contains the
`biochatter` Python package, a generic backend library for the connection of
biomedical applications to conversational AI.  Described in [this
preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06488) and used in
[ChatGSE](https://chat.biocypher.org), which is being developed at
https://github.com/biocypher/ChatGSE. More to come, so stay tuned!

BioChatter is part of the [BioCypher](https://github.com/biocypher) ecosystem, 
connecting natively to BioCypher knowledge graphs. The BioChatter paper is
being written [here](https://github.com/biocypher/biochatter-paper).

## Installation

To use the package, install it from PyPI, for instance using pip (`pip install
biochatter`) or Poetry (`poetry add biochatter`).

### Extras

The package has some optional dependencies that can be installed using the
following extras (e.g. `pip install biochatter[xinference]`):

- `xinference`: support for querying open-source LLMs through Xorbits Inference

- `podcast`: support for podcast text-to-speech (for the free Google TTS; the
paid OpenAI TTS can be used without this extra)

- `streamlit`: support for streamlit UI functions (used in ChatGSE)

## Usage

Check out the [documentation](https://biocypher.github.io/biochatter/) for
examples, use cases, and more information. Many common functionalities covered
by BioChatter can be seen in use in the
[ChatGSE](https://github.com/biocypher/ChatGSE) code base.

# Dev Container

Due to some incompatibilities of `pymilvus` with Apple Silicon, we have created
a dev container for this project. To use it, you need to have Docker installed
on your machine. Then, you can run the devcontainer setup as recommended by
VSCode
[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container)
or using Docker directly.

The dev container expects an environment file (there are options, but the basic
one is `.devcontainer/local.env`) with the following variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=(sk-...)
DOCKER_COMPOSE=true
DEVCONTAINER=true
```

To test vector database functionality, you also need to start a Milvus
standalone server. You can do this by running `docker-compose up` as described
[here](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md) on the host machine
(not from inside the devcontainer).
