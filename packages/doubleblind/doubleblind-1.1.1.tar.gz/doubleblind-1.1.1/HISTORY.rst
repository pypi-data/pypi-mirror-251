1.1.1 (2024-01-16)
------------------
Fixed bug that would cause the application to crash when attempting to update the DoubleBlind app.

1.1.0 (2023-07-31)
------------------
Added a 'Manual actions' menu that allows the user to manually blind or unblind names.
This is helpful when the automatic blinding/unblinding does not replace a blinded name in an additional data file, and you can't find its matching 'doubleblind_encoding' file.

1.0.1 (2023-07-11)
------------------
Fixed bug that prevented the stand-alone app from launching.

1.0.0 (2023-07-02)

First stable release.
