We are currently using this package in several large to medium-scale production
environments, but it should be considered a permanent work in progress.

Compatibility
=============
Currently, django-newsletter officially supports Django 2.2.x LTS, 3.1.x, and 3.2.x, and Python 3.6 through 3.9.

If you find any bugs or have a feature request for django-newsletter, don't hesitate to
open up an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/jazzband/django-newsletter/issues)
(but please make sure your issue hasn't been noticed before, finding duplicates is a
waste of time). When modifying or adding features to django-newsletter in a fork, be
sure to let me know what you're building and how you're building it. That way we can
coordinate whether, when, and how it will end up in the main fork and (eventually) an
official release.
