# 🪐 🌳 Jupyter Environments

> Environmnents for Jupyter.

Jupyter Environments allow Users to define the packages and libraries (Python...) that are used in their Kernels.

An Environment is also the place where Users define their Secrets and Environment Variables.

## Develop

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
jupyter labextension list
jupyter server extension list
yarn jupyterlab
```
